I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computational Fluid Mechanics at Carnegie Mellon University with expertise in CFD, FEA, and molecular dynamics. I have worked extensively with COMSOL, ANSYS, LAMMPS, and FEniCS, focusing on powertrain-relevant modeling including friction, lubrication, and mechanical response.
